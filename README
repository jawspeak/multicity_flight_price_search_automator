This is an automated price checking tool for multicity flights.

GETTING STARTED:
Start the selenium server with:
 java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.0b3.jar

I recommend using rvm to manage your ruby dependencies, at minimum you need: 
 gem install selenium-webdriver 

Edit what you will search in this file, and then run it:
 ruby price_scraper.rb



TODO LIST
- precreate the script of what routes to search to a file. Then work down that list when writing out the data. If an error happens, allow restarting from where you left off. (OR, just re-fetch the error rows in the csv).
- handle describing travel options in a YAML format, (multiple origin/destinations, multi city or round trip, and __?__ what else?)
